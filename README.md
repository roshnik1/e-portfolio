# e-portfolio (in progress)

Welcome to my ePortfolio! I am a recent graduate with a strong focus on data analysis and a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. My portfolio highlights various projects, including an analysis of SNL cast tenure and a sports analytics dashboard for tennis performance. I have hands-on experience with tools such as Python, SQL, and Power BI, and I am eager to leverage my skills to tackle real-world challenges and contribute to data-driven decision-making. Thank you for visiting, and feel free to reach out for collaboration opportunities!
